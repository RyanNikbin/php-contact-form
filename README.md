# Simple PHP Email Contact Form

This PHP script lets you send contact form submissions (like name, email, and message) to a specific email address. It uses **PHPMailer** to send emails securely via SMTP. The setup is inspired by **Composer**, a tool that helps manage the PHPMailer library and other dependencies in your PHP projects.

With this script, you can easily add email functionality to your website and send messages safely using SMTP encryption.
